My name is Wenhao Zhang and you might also know me as Wenonah. I am an undergraduate at **Claremont McKenna College** studying Economics and Applied Mathematics with some emphasis on Computer Science.  As a rising senior, I have dedicated myself to **Lowe Institute of Political Economy**, where I investigated the labor market condition in both Inland Empire and Coachella Valley and produced comprehensive economic and demographic annual reports. I developed my interest in quantitive methods through working on these public policy research. However, after I accidentally took the Stanford online Machine Learning course, constructing econometric models no long satisfies my curiosity.  I started to seek an opportunity to explore more in Data Science and Data Science for Social Good perfectly combines my previous experience in policy analysis as well as my passion to work on some data-intensive projects. 

This summer my team and I will continue the **ORCA** project from last year. Our ultimate goal is to assist the transit agencies in Seattle to better manage their resources and encourage collaboration within the industry to make people move around in the city faster. I am excited to hone my data-cleansing skill,  play around with spatial temporary data, and design a robust algorithm to classify the transfer pattern. Through this summer project,  I hope I can develop sufficient skills to prepare me for the data science researches and projects in industries.
